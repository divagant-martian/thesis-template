  abstract =     "Informally, a data stream is defined as an unbounded (or
                  never-ending) sequence of data items that are usually ordered
                  either explicitly by a timestamp or by the values of one or
                  more data elements (e.g., packet sequence identifier in an IP
                  session). It is assumed that the format of a data stream is
                  known in terms of its data elements and their
                  types. Simplistically, a data item of a data stream can be
                  viewed as a tuple1 of a relation. Correspondingly, a data
                  element of a data item is analogous to an attribute of a
                  relation.",

	abstract = {This paper considers the null hypothesis that the errors on a regression equation form a random walk. By using the standard Durbin-Watson assumptions, we derive three test statistics that are uniformly most powerful against the alternative hypothesis that the errors are being generated by the stationary first order Markoff process. Unfortunately, the tabulated lower and upper bounds are too wide apart and so we compare the powers of the three tests using simulated as well as economic data. It is then recommended that the Imhof routine should be attached to standard regression programs to calculate the exact limit of the Berenblut-Webb statistic.},

@book{Kocenda2014,
	Abstract = {This book presents the numerous tools for the econometric analysis of time series. The text is designed with emphasis on the practical application of theoretical tools. Accordingly, material is presented in a way that is easy to understand. In many cases intuitive explanation and understanding of the studied phenomena are offerd. Essential concepts are illustrated by clear-cut examples. The attention of readers is drawn to numerous applied works where the use of specific techniques is best illustrated. Such applications are chiefly connected with issues of recent economic transition and European integration. The outlined style of presentation makes the book also a rich source of references. The text is divided into five major sections. The first section, “The Nature of Time Series”, gives an introduction to time series analysis. The second section, “Difference Equations”, describes briefly the theory of difference equations with an emphasis on results that are important for time serie},
