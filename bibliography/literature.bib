  abstract =     "Informally, a data stream is defined as an unbounded (or
                  never-ending) sequence of data items that are usually ordered
                  either explicitly by a timestamp or by the values of one or
                  more data elements (e.g., packet sequence identifier in an IP
                  session). It is assumed that the format of a data stream is
                  known in terms of its data elements and their
                  types. Simplistically, a data item of a data stream can be
                  viewed as a tuple1 of a relation. Correspondingly, a data
                  element of a data item is analogous to an attribute of a
                  relation.",
